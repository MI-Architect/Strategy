## Strategy Requirements

Create a complete strategy following this proven structure:

### 1. **Exploration** (Research & Context)

- Reference specific strategies from "Crafting Engineering Strategy" or other authoritative sources
- Include both successful implementations and documented failures
- Cite specific companies, technologies, or frameworks where applicable

### 2. **Diagnosis** (Problem Analysis)
- Clearly articulate the root causes and constraints
- Use data and specific evidence to support your analysis
- Identify technical, organizational, and business factors
- Address both immediate symptoms and underlying issues
- Reference diagnostic frameworks from established strategy resources
